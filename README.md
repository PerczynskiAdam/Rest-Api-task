## Task Description
   The aim of this task was to create Rest Api that loads data from: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=Hobbit  
   Filter data by author (e.g. books?author="Jan Kowalski"&author="Anna Kowalska"), published_date (e.g. /books?published_date=1995)  
   Sort data (e.g. /books?sort=-published_date)  
   Post and update data from: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=war  

## Status
I'm working on updating objects now.
